DXF Files for reproducing VW Jeans Beetle Decals / Logos / Graphics

I've owned a jeans beetle for the past 19 years and reproduced the original decals around 2005 using a rubbing from a friends beetle that still had the original graphics.

Due to needing some recent welding work, I needed to re-cut one of the rear-quarter logos so after recovering the files from my old PC, I've uploaded them here so others can recreate their own without being limited to the few expensive sets that are available on the internet.

The door stripes can easily be cut by hand if you don't have access to a vinyl cutter, as can the Jeans logos if you have a steady hand and use print the templates to the correct scale.

I'll add the instructions for the correct placement when I have a chance to measure off of my car as they have been lost.
